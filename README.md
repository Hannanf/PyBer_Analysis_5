<h2>Module 5 Challenge — Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib Libraries to create a summary of Ride-Sharing Data and Graph Showing Total Weekly Fare for Each City Type
  </h2>

<h4>OVERVIEW 
</h4>

______________________________________________________________________
There are two main objectives to this assessment. In the first part we used Python, in particular the Pandas library to analysis raw data of rides taken by customers who lived in various regions. the objective of our analysis was to extrapolate the following metrics from our raw data
<br>
<br>1)Total number of rides for each city 
<br>2)Total number of rides for each city type 
<br>3)Sum of fares for each city type 
<br>4)Average fare per ride for each city 
<br>5)Average fare per drivers</br>

In the 2nd part of the assessment, we used the Matplolib library in Python to create graphs showing a visual representation of the total weekly fare for each city type.

<h4>RESULTS

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
As we can seen in figure 1, total fare collected is highest in urban areas, followed by suburban areas, and rural areas. We can see in figure 2 that most of the fare collected is from urban areas. figure 3 shows that msot of the drivers are in urban areas followed by suburban areas and finally by rural areas. figure 4 shows that most rides are taken in urban areas.

<h4>SUMMARY
</h4>

______________________________________________________________________

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.


1) As seen in figure 5, the drivers in the rural areas are taking on the most rides. I would advise the CEO to add more drivers to the rural areas 
2) As seen in figure 5, drivers in the urban areas are taking on the least number of rides. I would advise the CEO to reduce the number of drivers in the urban areas 
3) As seen Figure 3, urban area drivers make up 80.9% of total drivers among the 3 regions but as seen in figure in figure 2 they only get 62.7% of the total fares. An alternative to reducing number of drivers as recommend in 2), I would recommend increase the fare cost in urban areas
