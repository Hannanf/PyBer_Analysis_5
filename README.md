Module 5 Challenge — Using Python and the Pandas, and Matplotlib Libraries to create a summary of Ride-Sharing Data and Graph Showing Total Weekly Fare for Each City Type ]
______________________________________________________________________
OVERVIEW
______________________________________________________________________
The objective of this module is to use python, in particular the Pandas library to analysis raw data. We then used MAtplolib to create graphs showing a visual representation of the total weekly fare for each city type
In the first part of the module, we used the Pandas library to analse data to get the following information 
Total number of rides for each city 
Total number of rides for each city type 
Sum of fares for each city type 
Average fare per ride for each city 
Avarrge fare per drivers
In the 2nd part of the module we use the data from the first part along with the Matplolib library to create line graphs showing the fare collected over time for each city type

RESULTS

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
As we can seen in figure 1, total fare collected is highest in urban areas, followed by suburban areas, and rural areas.
